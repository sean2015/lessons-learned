Given today's challenges of coordinating programming and project efforts of remote team members, there's value in being able to gather everyone onto the same page.

Using a physical or virtual kanban board is ones means of visually tracking work there is to do (i.e. in the hopper), work in progress (say by developers), work waiting for QA,  work in progress (by QA), work completed/ready to ship, and finally work that is blocked.  As a manager, this enables one to prioritize efforts and understand where bottlenecks are developing so that you can better allocate resources or fix underlying problems.  Other benefits include eliminating waste, deferring decisions, delivering quickly, and limiting work in progress.

There are a variety of different tools available online to help with project management.  While each has its own strengths and weaknesses, it's not worth obsessing over which one to choose for smaller projects in which your team is less than or equal to 5 people.  Experimenting with a tool and then flexing to another one as needed is a better use of one's time.  Below are a few examples and some short notes on their advantages and disadvantages:

*Excel (the most basic, harder to change dynamically)
*Trello (flexible creation of boards that can mirror a kanban board, lacks swim lanes for more complex projects)
*BaseCamp (the industry standard with lots of flexibility, but you're limited to 1 free one before paying a monthly fee)
**Others: Jira, Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, Rally, and Mingle

Overall, there seems to be significant merit in completing any one individual project as a whole and having a minimally viable product rather than working a little on a lot of projects and having no finished products until the very end.
