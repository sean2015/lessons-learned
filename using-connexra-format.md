Maybe the most important takeaway from the course is the connexra format user story for specifying features for software.  The connexra format uses the following template for telling a user story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].  The format captures the who, what, and why in a succinct way that can be expressed on a sticky note.  It’s important to distinguish between an “epic” and a single feature.  For example, an epic might be: as a shopper, I want a website that allows me to buy books so I don’t have to go to the bookstore.”  A feature within that epic might be: as a shopper, I want a wishlist so I can record books I want to buy in the future someplace.
